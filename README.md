[Organizing information for use](http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2021/08/24/144925.html?title=organizingInformationForUse) - the seminal post by Ken Smith that got this idea started

"Here is the post-Berners-Lee, post-Snowden takeaway:

Messages are easy, easier than ever, but they go nowhere, they are useless, if the network has not been prepared.

That network is a piece of open technology tuned to worthwhile purposes and a web of people already aligned with each other and inside each person the knowledge, attitude, and skills needed to pitch in. That’s the message I’m getting from semaphore today."

I'd like a little button on Twitter that would allow me to designate up to a dozen of my tweets to serve as an introduction to my main concerns, producing something like this: What's @KenSmith about? It's about these dozen tweets, the issues they raise, the small points they begin to make, the fuller resources they point to elsewhere.

In my memory, the central insight of the World Outline was curating and including in a single outline the quality outlines of others, building through collaboration a more substantial body of quality material on a shared topic than one person alone could build.

http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2021/09/27/131027.html?title=bookmarkingOrLinkingTo

Linking to the site was a way of providing a wider context--who is this writer, what is this writer's project, what is this writer's claim to authority?

Linking to the particular posting was a way of saying that we all agree that the real chance for thinking together involves paying attention to the specific things the other person is saying. If we're not doing that, helping each other do that, we're not really all that interested in communication.

Most honorable of all practices was providing those two links AND quoting and discussing a key passage.

Journalists should see this (redistricting) as front page-worthy every day. Not just which state has handed down its new districts, but connecting the dots, the broad patterns, the finer grain implications, the places where people somehow manage to push back.

Front page every day. "You have to give the people time..." (to call their congressmen, to flood the phones of the district offices...quotes from video link)

http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2021/09/24/015845.html?title=vsPowerpoint

In a discussion today a much more interesting path was described, using an outliner like this one, projecting on a screen, but taking live notes, revising as needed, tagging tasks with names and report-back dates maybe, and giving everyone an agreed-upon set of meeting notes at the end. Many folks would see their suggestions go up on the screen and they'd be in the take-home outline notes. There'd be buy-in from all of that. It would feel productive, respectful, hopeful.

“It's amazing how much of writing is moving things around.” 

http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2021/09/23/182834.html?title=noWonderNoWonder

If revising is, in large part, the act of clarifying, illustrating, and testing the relationship between neighboring sentences--over and over and over again--no wonder writing can sometimes be so difficult.

But near the end, Sabbith describes real politics accurately--it takes time for people to notice and understand an issue, time to decide to act, time to form alliances, time to make their concerns public, etc. The speech is a mini-primer on political process, or a portion of it.

Any form of journalism that doesn't take into account the time needed for political understanding, engagement, and action is either oblivious to the workings of politics, satisfied with insiders running everything, or indifferent to the quality of decision-making in the nation.

This seems like it will open up new writing-organizing-revising work habits that promise to help explode the limitations of timeline-only composing schemes and solo-document-type composing schemes. I've been wanting to be able to bust open those two narrow spaces for some time now, or to cross back and forth at will. There are traces in old web posts that others have wished for this even longer than I have.

The bookmark outline reaches (kind of like an index) into other outlines, including timeline-based ones, and establishes a composing space that can use or refer to those timeline spaces as much or as little as the writer wishes. Hyperlinks partake of a portion of the index process or function, too, yes? Tagging crosses the borders of a single outline or a single document in an index-like way. Tagging that presents itself in an editable space, such as in a wiki (mused upon in discussion somewhere this summer), would break things open in a new way.

This will seem vague or inexact but here goes. Thanks to these new kinds of tools, ndex becomes index process becomes hybrid index process/composing-revising-publishing space.

So the specificity of the first soloist's phrasing should in some specific way be acknowledged in the notes played by the second. Lots of ways to do that, I believe, but still, the link should be noticeable to a thoughtful listener.

This implies a more or less tangible standard for communication that could apply to social media exchanges. The specificity of the seed message should be recognizable in some way in the reply. If it isn't, then the first writer is right to feel wronged in some way, such as being misunderstood, being misrepresented, etc. Possibly having been engaged only in a tangential way.

http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2021/09/17/122110.html?title=politicalAllianceSmartPhoneApp

Exiled political associates of Aleksei Navalny have worked up a phone app that invites Russian voters to choose the candidates most likely to have a chance against the Putin-controlled United Russia party for a seat in parliament, no matter what party's candidate the data analysis points to. So, an anybody-but-Putin's-people strategy, aiming to energize opposition in a highly manipulated political landscape.

Hoping to prove in a high profile way that tactical opposition can be meaningful there once again. Using research, messaging tools, essential alliances, and publicity to do so.

"What bloggers are guilty of -- always -- is telling their story imperfectly," Dave Winer wrote in "Blogging matters," a 2013 post. 

Working in that spirit, a blogger shouldn't claim to have the last say on something, knowing that the blog is a collection of views and experiences, not a pronouncement from authority.

Working in that spirit leaves room for talking with other people, trading ideas, letting thoughts improve and grow. Working in that spirit invites readers not to play power games, though some might do so anyway.

http://scripting.com/2013/12/30/peopleDontUnderstandBlogging

It's important to feel free to tell your story even if it cues up other people's permission to be jerks. 

I don't have a solution, other than to say it helps to stand beside people who put themselves out there. The world is rough. That doesn't mean you can't share what you see. It just means it's important to feel the support. I want to provide what little of that I can, through this post.

http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2021/09/14/221417.html?title=twoTraitsOfAnOutliner

Outliner software speeds the flexing that a writer recognizes as the writing process.

http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2021/09/13/012153.html?title=yesterdaysHunch

Outlining (like creating an outline for a paper) and using an outliner (like Drummer/Little Outliner/OPML Editor) are two different things.

http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2021/09/12/164650.html?title=barriersToGrokkingOutlining

These students grow up and someday may run across outlining software and think back on the bad teaching they received and think, "Why would I want to spend time with that?" Understandable.

But they lose the opportunity to explore something very different from the outlining they might have been taught. The opportunity to compose and revise in a piece of software that brings a writer certain advantages in creating linked thought because it is something called an outliner. It is structured to help a writer establish and display meaningful relationships between adjoining content. Which, as I claimed above, is what good paragraphs do.
